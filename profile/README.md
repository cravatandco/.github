**Scimus Cui Prodest** — *We Know Who Benefits*

Lobbying is a partnership. In this firm, we believe that cases must be made and arguments must be heard. We make them. We take the work seriously, guided by 14 Principles and 10 Commandments adapted from the highest standards of professional excellence.

## Our Philosophy

We have adapted our governing principles from those drafted by John Whitehead of Goldman Sachs. While originally intended for investment banking, we believe professional excellence transcends industry.

### The 14 Principles
1. **The client’s interests always come first.** Our success follows yours.
2. **Our assets are people, capital, and reputation.** Reputation is the hardest to regain once lost.
3. **Excellence is non-negotiable.** We would rather be the best than the biggest.
4. **Creativity is paramount.** We constantly seek better solutions to client problems.
5. **We recruit one by one.** Without the best people, we cannot be the best firm.
6. **Advancement is based on merit.** We find no limits to the responsibility our best people can assume.
7. **Teamwork is our engine.** We have no room for those who put personal interests above the firm.
8. **Dedication is our hallmark.** Our people give an intensity of effort rarely found elsewhere.
9. **Profitability is a means, not just an end.** It allows us to recruit and retain the best talent.
10. **Size is an asset to be preserved.** We remain big enough to handle any project, yet small enough to maintain intimacy.
11. **Anticipate change.** Complacency in lobbying leads to extinction.
12. **Confidentiality is absolute.** To breach a confidence is unthinkable.
13. **Fair competition.** We seek to expand aggressively but never denigrate our competitors.
14. **Integrity is the heart of our business.** We expect high ethical standards in both professional and personal lives.

### The 10 Commandments
*   Don’t waste time on business we don’t want.
*   Know the boss; the boss usually decides.
*   Seek first-rate business; it is as easy to get as the second-rate variety.
*   You never learn anything while you are talking.
*   The client’s objective outweighs your own.
*   The respect of one person is worth more than the acquaintance of one hundred.
*   When there is business to be done, get it.
*   Important people prefer to deal with other important people.
*   There is nothing worse than an unhappy client.
*   If you get the business, ensure it is well handled.
